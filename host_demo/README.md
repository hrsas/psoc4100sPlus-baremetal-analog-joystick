\# Host Demo – Endless Runner Game



This Python application demonstrates the usage of the \*\*PSoC 4100S Plus bare-metal analog joystick controller\*\*.



Joystick position data received over \*\*UART\*\* is mapped to left, center, and right movement in a simple endless runner game.  

The game acts as a \*\*proof-of-functionality\*\* for the embedded firmware, validating real-time control using external hardware input.



This folder contains only \*\*host-side code and assets\*\*.  

The embedded firmware runs independently on the PSoC device.
