# psoc4100s--baremetal-analog-joystick
A bare-metal analog joystick controller implemented on the Infineon PSoC 4100S Plus, where a potentiometer acts as a directional input device. The system uses register-level configuration of the SAR ADC, TCPWM timer, and UART to periodically sample analog input, demonstrating interrupt-driven timing and low-level embedded system design.
